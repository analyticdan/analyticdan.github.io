  <h1 class="header">Welcome to Dan's GithHub Page!</h1>
  <p>
    My name is Daniel and this is my website on GitHub.
    In case you don't know who I am or what I look like,
    this is a picture of me dressed up in my Sunday's best
    from 2016 on the night of my senior prom:

  <h1>About Me:</h1>
  <h2>Education:</h2>
  <p>
    After graduating from Oakland Technical High School in 2016, I went to
    the University of California, Berkeley, where I graduated with a B.A.
    in computer science from the College of Letters and Sciences in 2020
    with a 3.69 GPA.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the pursuit of my computer science degree, I focused on taking as
    many systems classes as I could (the 160s series), which included
    classes on:
  <ul>
    <li>
      operating systems, where I learned about the basics of
      operating systems: the division of user space and kernel space,
      system calls, interrupts, synchronization and locking/mutexes,
      scheduling, virtual memory, file systems, and the challenges of
      distributed systems. In this class, we had a semester-long
      project to enhance a barebones operating system called PintOS
      with the ability to run user programs with arguments,
      priority schedule and execute multiple user threads, and
      perform buffered reads and writes to a Unix FFS file system,
      which was done in teams of four.
    </li>
    <li>
      compilers and programming languages, where I learned the
      computer science theoretical underpinnings of lexing, parsing,
      semantically analyzing, and generating and optimizing code for
      compilation of high level programming languages to assembly.
      In particular, I learned about finite state machines and
      various grammars to classify programming languages and the
      algorithmic tools to lex and parse them. I also learned about
      scoping for type checking and semantic analysis, flow diagrams
      for optimizing code blocks, stack and register machines for
      generating and executing code, and garbage collection. In this
      class, We had a semester long project to write a lexer, parser,
      semantic analyser, and (optimized) RISC-V code generator for a
      typed variant of Python 2.5 called ChocoPy. The project was
      meant for groups of two, but in my enthusiasm, I mostly
      completed the projects on my own.
    </li>
    <li>
      networking, where I learned about how routing is done, both on
      the Internet and on intranets, about TCP, and about DNS.
    </li>
    <li>
      computer security, where I learned basic cyber-exploits, such
      as buffer overflow attacks, SQL injections, CSRF, and XSS. Our
      projects in this class were to implement a number of these
      attacks on a provided, insecure server or VM and to create a
      program that implemented a file sharing functionality while
      minimizing the number of attacks that the service was
      susceptible to.
    </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Although not officially part of my degree, I also studied math up to
    linear and abstract algebra and real analysis at the undergraduate
    level, and economics, taking classes in introductory macroeconomics,
    intermediate microeconomics, and a class on auctions and game theory.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also have interests in biology, though not at the collegiate level,
    having taken AP Biology and AP Chemistry in high school receiving 5s
    (out of 5) in both, particularly metabolic and evolutionary biology.

        I've tried every diet under the sun: calorie counting (IIFYM),
        intermittent fasting, prolonged fasting, low carb/keto, high carb,
        high protein, vegetarian, paleo, and have tried to understand the
        metabolic underpinnings of the obesity epidemic. Having tried and
        failed at these diets, I believe in a somewhat unorthodox theory that
        the two major contemporary illnesses of our time, depression and
        obesity, are linked in that both are caused by an excessive pathogenic
        load.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first clue for me is a teleological explanation of depression
        (and obesity), which is that acute depression is an evolutionary
        adaptation meant to conserve energy for repair after a bodily injury.
        Many of the symptoms of depression, e.g. lethargy, hypersomnia, and
        avoidance of people, are adaptive when it comes to preventing the
        spread of disease. The inflammation that occurs in people with
        depression is also symptomatic of an immune response. Heat denatures
        proteins that bacteria rely on to metabolize energy substrates and/or
        reproduce. Though fever can be fatal for humans in some cases, the
        body has an efficient respiratory system to minimize self-cell damage
        that foreign microbes cannot paracetize so well. Though some believe
        inflammation causes illness, I believe that inflammation is a sign
        that the body is already ill. That is to say, I believe the arrow of
        causality is reversed from the popular science point of view.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once this acute inflammation turns chronic, however, the body
        requires more energy to maintain this high body temperature. Fat
        accumulates around the midsection as an attempt to insulate the core.
        Hunger hormones go into overdrive. Whether the person craves sugar to
        make use of its readily metabolized glucose monomers, fat for its
        high energy density, or protein for its high thermic effect, the
        result of chronic inflammation is high energy demand to complete the
        immune process, along the way causing obesity and other problems for
        organs like the liver in the case of non-alcoholic fatty liver
        disease or certain forms of pancreatitis and heart disease by storing
        fat and shuttling energy for use elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        My belief is the issue is best remedied by a form of acute heat
        therapy, which mimics fever to denature the pathogens proteins,
        thereby killing them and rendering them unable to reproduce once the
        body's internal temperature is sustained around 101 degrees
        Fahrenheit. Ensuring that one is clothed in properly insulating
        attire when not in heat therapy is also recommended from my point of
        view. Aside from that, I would recommend boiling water before
        consumption to decrease pathogenic load as much as possible. At a
        time when aging pipe infrastructure diminishes tap water quality in
        the developed world, the public is more unconscious of the role of
        water-borne illnesses than ever. Cholera, typhoid, and TB are may
        seem like quaint, old world diseases, but their descendants are not.
        If the statistics are right, we are getting less of our water intake
        from boiled coffees and teas and more of our water intake from
        dubiously filtered tap water in reusable bottle form. The plagues of
        old have come back, but hide themselves with new disguises, I claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regarding the effects of reducing obesity via heat therapy, I only
        have anecdotal evidence from my own experience, but on the effects of
        heat therapy on depression, there is a study from UW Madison showing
        that when patients were subject to infrared lights that brought their
        core temperature up to 38.5 degrees C, or 101.3 degrees F, their
        depression went away for up to six weeks post-treatment. I can
        personally attest to heat therapy for the treatment of depression,
        too.
      </p>
      <p>
        As to why depression and obesity have been rising in recent years,
        I would attribute at least some of the cause, ironically enough, to
        climate change, though there are probably a myriad of reasons. While
        fever temperatures are enough to kill pathogens, slight increases in
        temperature have dramatic effects on the rate of reaction, such as
        those that keep bacteria alive and help them to proliferate. As
        homeotherms, we don't notice the effects of slight temperature
        changes so much, given that we regulate temperature in large part
        internally, but for life forms that cannot regulate body temperature
        in this way, any slight increase in temperature can influence their
        survivability dramatically. If their reproduction is exponential,
        this would mean the proliferation of bacterial and viral life
        heretofore unseen in the modern world.

    I also have interests in literature and philosophy. With regard to the
    ancients, I read Sophocles' "Oedipus Rex" and "Antigone," Plato's
    "Republic" and "The Death of Socrates" in high school and I read
    Aristotle's "Nicomachean Ethics" in college. In terms of the moderns,
    I've dead Descartes, Hobbes, and Rousseau in college and dabbled in some
    Neitzche on my own time. I've enjoyed the Russian authors Dostoyevsky,
    Lermontov, and Tolstoy, which I read on my own time. As for contemporary
    literature, I enjoyed “White Tiger” by Aravind Adiga when I read it in
    2012.
  </p>
  <h2>Professional:</h2>
  <p>
    Most recently, I've worked as a Software Developer for two years
    (2021-2023), working in React/JS and Java. Aside from JavaScript/JSX and
    Java, I'm also comfortable in Python. I have also worked with Go/Golang
    and C in the past, building school projects at university, but may be
    rustier in those languages.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've also worked odd jobs, namely as a warehouse worker in an Amazon in
    2020-2021 warehouse and as an IT support tech in 2016.

  <h2>Personal:</h2>
  <h3>Music:</h3>
  <p>
    I have a deep appreciation of music, particularly 4th to 2nd generation
    K-pop groups. I grew up to my cousin, her friends, and my peers on the
    internet listening to K-pop and watching Korean dramas in the heyday of
    the 2nd generation of Girl's Generation, 2NE1, and Taeyang, but my
    interest in K-pop started in 2021, when I first heard STAYC's single
    "ASAP" on recommendation from the YouTube algorithm. Since then, I've
    branched out into other 4th Generation groups, such as ENHYPHEN, IVE,
    (G)-IDLE, and NewJeans and gone back to listen to 3rd generation idol
    groups such as Blackpink, TWICE, and Red Velvet.
  </p>
  <p>
    I grew up listening to EDM/hardstyle and dubstep. My favorite hardstyle
    tracks were Angerfist's "No ******* Soul" and "Bite Your Style," Thah
    Playah's "Walking the Line," and Nitrogenetics' "Inside Your Head." I
    also enjoyed listening to hardstyle mixes produced by "WhynayEmnayRS"
    from his six-part series entitled "Slayertraxx," available on his YouTube
    channel.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also listen to rap music from time to time: Eminem, A$AP Rocky, A$AP
    Ferg, ScHoolboy Q, Kendrick Lamar, Joey Bad*** to name a few.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also occasionally listen to classical music while I work, particularly
    Erik Satie's "Gymnopedie No.1" and Chopin's "Nocturne Op.9 No.2," but I
    have been enjoying Giuseppe Tartini's "Violin Sonata in G minor," also
    known as the "Devil's Trill Sonata" and Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata."
  </p>
  <p>
    In general, I would say I like a variety of forms of music, as there are
    many other musical artists which I also listen to, depending on my mood.
  </p>
</body>
<h3>Christianity:</h3>
<p>
  I am a Roman Catholic, having grown up in the Roman Catholic tradition and
  been baptized at the now defunct St. Mary's Church and confirmed at St.
  Anthony's Church, both in Oakland, California. I became an atheist or an
  agnostic in middle school and high school, then became interested in
  religions of all sorts, primarily Eastern Mysticism and ancient myths like
  those written about in Joseph Campbell's “Hero With a Thousand Faces,”
  in college.
</p>
<p>
  My conversion to Christianity began late in my college career, when I kept
  hearing about Peter Thiel's Christianity. I read and listened to his works
  voraciously. To this day, I still read and re-read his essays “The
  Straussian Moment” and the “The Optimistic Thought Experiment” and listen
  to his interviews, particularly his interview with Eric Weinstein, which
  help form the basis of my belief in Christ.
</p>
<p>
  The pace of my conversion sped up when I began mimicking Peter Thiel's
  adoration for his mentor, the late French Christian and anthropologist
  Rene Girard. As I read the Girard Reader for the first time, I had a Saul
  on the Road to Damascus moment where I felt as though Girard's explanation
  of Christianity and the mimetic and scapegoating processes were so obvious,
  yet hidden. I sat down to write various essays, trying to refute the
  Christian message, but I always found logical inconsistencies in my
  argument and felt compelled to admit that the anti-sacrificial message of
  Christianity was the “narrow … road that leads to life” (Matthew 7:14).
</p>
<p>
  Today, I am a Roman Catholic by tradition, but my belief in Christianity is
  largely thanks to the work of Peter Thiel and Rene Girard.
