            My name is Daniel Nguyen and this is my website. In case you don't know who I am or what I look like, this is a picture of me from 2016.

                            I was so young here! This is from my senior prom. I don't really have any other suitable picture that is more up-to-date, so this will just have to do. If you want to stay on this page any longer, you'll just have to put up with my smug 18 year old face. <br> :)

            Currently, I am studying computer science at the University of California, Berkeley where I will graduate in May, 2020. At Cal, I have had the joy of studying about operating systems, compilers, microeconomics, and abstract algebra, among many other wonderful topics. After college (or university, for those of you ouside of North America), I hope to find a career building interesting gadgets and gizmos that other people would enjoy using.

            Outside of school, I enjoy many things fitness. I've ran, I've swam, and I've lifted. These days, I mostly just run. I've been running on and off recreationally since my early teen years. To me, there is nothing more blissful than putting on my running shoes, turning on my favorite music or podcast, and letting my worries drift away as my mind is forced to focus on running. In high school, I swam on my school's varsity swim team for four years. Although not my favorite form of cardio, I especially enjoyed the community and comraderie that I was able to build as a swimmer that I don't find running. Also in high school, I was a fairly strong lifter of weights, having achieved a 305 lb. squat, a 295 lb. deadlift, and a 140 lb. bench.
