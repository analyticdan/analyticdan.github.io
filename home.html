            My name is Daniel and this is my website. In case you don't know who I am or what I look like, this is a picture of me from 2016.

                            I don't really have any other suitable picture that is more up-to-date, so this will just have to do. If you want to stay on this page any longer, you'll just have to put up with my smug 18 year old face. :)

            In the May of 2020, I finished up my bachelor's degree in computer science from the University of California, Berkeley. At Cal, I had the joy of studying operating systems, compilers and programming languages, microeconomics, and abstract algebra, among many other interesting topics. I am currently on the hunt for a career in software building interesting gadgets and gizmos that other people might enjoy using.

            Outside of school, I enjoy many things fitness. I've ran, swam, and lifted. These days, I mostly just run. I've been running on and off recreationally since my early teen years. To me, there's nothing more blissful than putting on my running shoes, turning on my favorite playlists or podcasts, and letting my worries drift away while I focus on breathing and not dying. In high school, I swam on my school's varsity swim team for four years. Although not my favorite form of cardio, I especially enjoyed the community and comraderie that I was able to build as a swimmer that I don't find as much running. Also in high school, I was a fairly strong lifter of weights, having achieved a 305 lb. squat, a 295 lb. deadlift, and a 140 lb. bench.
